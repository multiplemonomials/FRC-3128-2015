This is code for the Aluminum Narwhals FRC competition
It'll run on the RoboRIO when that comes out.

It also includes headers for the FRC robot library, wpilib,
which it uses for compilation (there's no way it can link successfully until the library is actually released for the new platform.

Lastly, this repository is an Eclipse CDT project and requires boost
(it is built with v1.54)
